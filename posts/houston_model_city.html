            <p>It takes a special type of person to hear the words &ldquo;Houston&rdquo; and &ldquo;model city&rdquo; together and agree. Yet such a distinction is growing in popularity, despite many counter arguments. Goodbye Austin, Boston, Seattle, or San Francisco. Houston truly is a model city of the future. All it takes is to remove your rose-tinted glasses.</p>
            <p>As a sprawling metropolis with no formal zoning, a patchworked suburban landscape surrounding little urban bubbles, Houston has never truly seemed like an attractive place to live. It wasn&rsquo;t for me. The summers are oppressive. The flooding chronic. Yet after spending more than 8 years in this city, I have joined the choir lauding it as a model future city.</p>
            <p>My reasoning for doing so is begins by recognizing the separation between an idealized future with flying cars and techno-suits, and the realities of 1984 on earth. Humans are far too lazy to achieve our dystopian visions. And though we live in a world that would be considered utterly magical by members of society 50 years ago, change is still a grinding process. Just try watching grass grow. So looking through a lens of reality (as Sorel might say through the eyes of a true pessimist), we can see Houston as a model for the organic changes anticipated to occur through society within the next decades.</p>
            <p>The metrics to observe are multiculturalism, economic diversity, and metropolitan landscape. In these respects, particularly in multiculturalism, Houston shines as an example for other cities. How can so many different people from diverse backgrounds interact? How can a city founded on deregulated industry evolve into a highly livable location? Of course, the Kinder Institutes papers provide a better overview and answer to these questions. But from my limited opinion, one can look to Houston for example. Metropolises across the country would be remiss to balk at the swamp city down south.</p>
