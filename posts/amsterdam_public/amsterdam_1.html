            <p>Sitting in STACH caf&eacute; before heading to the airport, I can stop and reflect on an outstandingly personal trip in Amsterdam. It's amazing how much life can be drawn from so short a time. If we can say life flows like a river, then it can flow languidly for months or years only to be punctuated by falls and rapids. Short intense bursts of life that rush by so rapidly but are filled with currents of excitement. Such would describe the past week.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In a brief span so much has been learned and explored. It was a trip expressing years of self-reflection and growth. Through independence I sought out an itinerary that would best serve who I am as an individual. Instead of having to accept something which made sense or would be interesting to most people, I could express what made sense and interested me. That is what made my time meaningful.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The labyrinth of streets interrupted by canals. Old cobblestone alleyways framed by buildings tightly packed like crayons in a box. Amsterdam's unique history and Calvinist roots contrasts with the modern liberalism and 'coffee' shops. Without any phone service I had to embrace the special patience necessary to wander without anxiousness. I found myself lost too many times to count.</p>

            <tr><td><img src="../../img/DSCF3099.JPG" alt="TEST" >

            <p>I remember a meeting I had with my professor Dr. Sabharwal, back when I did research in the Scalable Health Labs. He explained that I should never see my research as a straight line from point A to point B. It would be good to get from point A to point B, of course, but in my young impatience I shouldn't discount the path in between. He had a picture of a squiggly line going every which way, looping around itself, going back and forward, before finally reaching the end. There would be meandering.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Simply getting lost without cell service reminded me how I needed to be patient and persistent. By trying to rush life, it's very easy to ignore the moments happening right now. I want to get to tomorrow, to the next week or the next year. If only Christmas would come sooner! It sounds silly, but I think there is something special about getting lost while walking. Cars have been made to speed up our journeys from one point to another. Our expectation of many modern systems is to hasten our experience to reach the better ones to come. Perhaps we get so comfortable with speeding through each experience patience gives way to a desire to make sure the line between point A and B, and then B and C, and C and D, so on and so forth is as efficient as possible. While walking I remembered the wisdom Dr. Sabharwal had given, and how tremendously accurate it was not just of research, but of almost everything meaningful in life.</p>

            <p>I came to Amsterdam to learn more about the thread count research Dr. Johnson has been working on with the Van Gogh Museum. It sounds incredible that they would use signal processing to classify the legitimacy of world famous paintings. I could focus on what that meant for a whole week. After my first meeting with Dr. Eric Postma of Tillburg University and JADS, it became clear that would be just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>At the intersection of cultural heritage and scientific exploration, new ways of understanding history and art have blossomed. (There is far too much to discuss on this subject to go into any further detail and not make this post long as lying Pinocchio's nose. It'll be saved for a different space.) As Teio Meedendorp of the Van Gogh Museum remarked, sometimes you feel like everything there is to know is known on a subject, only to be proven absolutely wrong. Both Mr. Meedendorp and Dr. Ella Hendriks (from the University of Amsterdam) see vast potential for the impacts of digital research on conservation and art history. Understanding the way colors used in paintings fade is perhaps one of the most pressing and interesting questions to answer. It would let museums consider how paintings as living pieces have changed over time. (Van Gogh's "The Bedroom" exemplifies this.) A methodology for automatically processing paintings to present their original color pallets is as yet unsolved.</p>

            <p>I wandered a lot this past week. At one point I just walked around the city for a few hours, exploring and thinking, until I arrived back at the place I had started. I spent hours just listening to people talk about their fields and not worrying if our conversation veered vastly away from the path I had planned for it. And in a foreign country across the Atlantic I often did what I do normally: grab a cup of coffee at some coffee house and drink over a good book. I feel incredibly blessed to have been able to meet the people I did, and learn all that I now know. It was a week of a million tiny moments lived without anticipation of the next. Reaching the end of my time here, I wouldn't have changed a thing about it. What great time spent living.</p>
