                  <p>Southwest Airlines likes to tout "Transfarency" as a welcome break from the price gouging typical to modern airlines. I wish Rice would do the same. Though I am graduating and won&rsquo;t feel the effects of it, Rice has again decided to increase the cost of attendance. As the Thresher <a href="http://www.ricethresher.org/article/2018/03/tuition-increases-2018">reported</a>, next year&rsquo;s cost of attendance is projected to be $61,000. This is egregious. There is an essential lack of transparency and honesty surrounding the cost of attendance at this University, spurred on by the same lack of transparency and honesty in peer institutions. Over my time as a student Rice has raise the cost of attendance twice, each time increasing it by over 3%. My financial aid still hovers at 0%. I was what you might call a middle achiever in high school: in a competitive school I eked out a resume <em>just </em>strong enough to have me admitted into Rice. Dogged by family troubles, and never helped by my poor work ethic, I did not do well enough to earn scholarships. When I received my acceptance to Rice and saw that it came with no scholarship or financial aid, I tossed it aside. I should pay $200,000, for four years!? Listen, my parents had worked hard to make sure they could cover my time in college, but they didn&rsquo;t rob the treasury. We didn&rsquo;t have such piles of cash sitting around for me, the middle of three children. It took a while for my parents to decide they would still support me financially if I chose to go to Rice, and longer still for me to look back over Rice as an option.</p>
                  <p>What really sucks is that we agreed as a family to attend Rice when it came in at $204,600 for four years. It was beyond the edge of what we had considered reasonable. For Fall 2018 the cost of attendance will be $61,000, with projected four-year costs at $245,380. The 3.2% increase outpaced a U.S. inflation of 2.1% in 2017. Based on current incremental rises in cost of attendance year after year, the projected cost of attendance should well exceed $250,000 for students matriculating in 2018. Had the cost been so high back then, I don&rsquo;t think I would have still made the decision to attend Rice. It is troubling, then, that when the cost of attendance was raise by approximately 3% repeatedly while attending, I could not stop it. The story I had been told, how much I was expecting Rice to cost, had changed. The process was clearly obscured to my family and I as an incoming student. I had to stomach the increase costs quietly. My parents and I talked a bit about it, but what could we do? It&rsquo;s not like I could refuse the increases. The only way to refuse the rate hikes is to drop out, or transfer, both not really options on the table. I had to accept them, multiple rises over my time at Rice, because they were out of my control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>This practice is wrong. If a student is accepted into the institution with a projected cost of attendance, that cost should not rise during their four years, when they are trapped with no choice. A student should not face the choice of accepting the rising costs or dropping out. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like much of a choice to me. Even if you do believe that elite universities should be charging students these exorbitant fees for attendance based on their projected return on investment, it is not fair to raise costs while a student is locked into a university when the initial decision took into account a significantly lower dollar sum.</p>
                  <p>To combat this, students and parents should mandate a fixed tuition, and room and board. At Rice, the college system creates a trap where room and board are more closely linked to cost of attendance than other universities, since most students live on campus for 3 of their 4 years. While I believe tuition hikes are unnecessary and a byproduct of poor management of resource spending, they appear inevitable in the current climate. Tying costs of tuition and room and board to matriculation year ensures that students and parents get a fair deal. Projected costs of attendance on college websites treat tuition and room and board as fixed costs over time, despite a clear trend of increasing costs. This practice demonstrates a latent effort to obscure ultimately higher costs of attendance over time. The price a student comes in with should be the price they will leave with. It&rsquo;s not a complex model to implement, and a significantly fairer one.</p>
                  <p>For universities, the model will offer a latent benefit: alumni donations. By increasing tuition significantly over my time at Rice, while maintaining zero financial aid or scholarship, I have grown to resent the administration&rsquo;s decisions. The lack of honesty on my cost of attendance makes me critical of any fundraising by the university. Why should I donate to a system that took advantage of my position? I feel like I am pressed for my ability to pay as much as possible during my time, not that I am given a gift of an education during my four years and should kindly pay in back in the future. If the administration wants to encourage a sense of fiscal duty toward the institution and for alumni to donate in future years, they should freeze the cost of attendance for matriculating classes. Keeping costs frozen will make students (and their parents) feel they given a fairer deal. Better than being taken advantage of. Those in the fundraising arm of the university should hope for this, before receiving more and more polite &ldquo;No.&rdquo; s from alumni, myself included.</p>
