            <p>Chances are that at one point or another in your life you have thought about something, and then not followed through on it. Maybe you planned out a diet only to give up by the third day, or decided on a monthly budget and overspent. I know I find myself guilty of not following through on plans. I'll talk with a friend about catching up but four months later and we never made it happen. (Yeah, sorry about that.)&nbsp; If we're being honest with ourselves, it's virtually impossible not to go through life missing the mark, or falling short on whatever you set out to accomplish. That's just being human. And recently, that gap between <em>thinking</em>, when we in our heads say we will go do something, and <em>doing </em>, when we go out and do whatever it is, seems to be widening. Now to me that's an interesting and counter-intuitive trend. On aggregate we seem to be getting worse at following through. <em>Why is that happening? </em>Let's take a step back and understand our context.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you've been on Twitter or Facebook in recent years, you might have noticed the tendency for people to post heartfelt or passionate commentaries, only to really never act on anything. As in, they will type out a post, share it with the world, then leave it at that--contained in virtual space. It's like whoever sits down at the keyboard is totally independent from the person who stands up and exists in the world, and the thoughts written down tend to go orthogonally to the character and actions of the person who wrote those thoughts in the first place. When it comes to sharing, people now have the option to get a surrogate for the warm fuzziness of actual accomplishment through social acceptance. If before a thought would be an itch that couldn't be scratched without action, nowadays we have the option to scratch that itch just by sharing and consuming information online.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;In a more digital age, a widening gap of<em> thinking </em>and <em>doing </em>makes a bit of sense. Without the necessity of physical proximity, computers allow individuals greater freedom of knowledge and exploration. Horizons are expanded and content consumption becomes as easy as <em>*click*. </em>Whereas before the advent of the always-connected-life physical proximity limited the amount of information an individual could get their hands on, modern connectivity removes this bottleneck. Humanity has been thrust into a new reality where the volume of information one can access approaches infinity. We're stuck in perpetual information overload.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One of the side effects of such an information overload is a tendency toward greater consumption via curation. Instead of reading a book we watch a video or scroll through a feed. But unlike a museum curator, generally the algorithms which curate the feeds base decisions on what holds attention, not what is the best content. People are then exposed to a wider range of experiences while spending time browsing, and as one spends more time browsing, they lose time that could be spent experiencing. It's my guess from this is that as our appetite for experience grows while our time for it decreases, the gap between our <em>thinking</em> and our <em>doing</em> widens.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Ultimately our propensity to fall short of our goals will never change. It's why ambition and failure go hand in hand. But recognizing the pitfalls of the new digital landscape can allow one to acknowledge both its beneficial and negative outcomes. More often than not, spending time in front of a screen engaging in other people's shared experiences does not augment your own. Slowly but surely it just widens the mental gap, and in connecting the world, we seem to have disconnected our thoughts from our actions.</p>
